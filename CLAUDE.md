# ClubOS — Project Reference

## What is this?
AI-powered country club management SaaS ("ClubOS") — built to disrupt legacy club software (Jonas Club, Northstar, ClubEssential). Handles member management, billing, bookings, communications, and has a Claude-powered AI chat assistant as a key differentiator.

## Tech Stack
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces
- **Web**: Next.js 15 (App Router) in `apps/web`
- **iOS**: Native Swift/SwiftUI app in `apps/ios` (distributed via TestFlight)
- **Backend/DB**: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Realtime, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **Payments**: Stripe (Connect for multi-tenant, Subscriptions for recurring dues)
- **AI Chat**: Claude API via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + CSS custom properties (green primary theme)
- **Validation**: Zod (shared between web and API)
- **Email**: Resend (invite, invoice, announcement, booking confirmation templates)
- **Testing**: Jest 30 + ts-jest
- **Deployment**: Vercel (web) + TestFlight/App Store (iOS)

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **Multi-tenant**: Each club is an org. All tables have `club_id` FK. Row-Level Security scopes all queries to the user's club.
- **Auth flow**: Supabase Auth → middleware checks session → redirects to `/login` if unauthenticated. Public routes: `/`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/auth/callback`.
- **Shared package**: Types and Zod schemas in `@club/shared` are imported by the web app. Import as `import { Member, createMemberSchema } from "@club/shared"`.
- **AI Chat**: POST `/api/chat` → authenticates user via Supabase → sends messages to Claude API. Gracefully handles missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. iOS app calls the same endpoint.
- **iOS app**: Native Swift/SwiftUI app with Supabase Auth (Keychain token persistence). Tab bar navigation (Home, Bookings, Events, AI Chat, Profile). Distributed via TestFlight.
- **API auth pattern**: `createApiClient()` helper handles both cookie auth (web) and Bearer token auth (iOS). Returns `{ supabase, adminClient, caller }` where `caller` has `member: MemberWithTier` with `tier_name` and `tier_level` (but NOT `member_number` — query separately if needed).
- **Family billing**: ALL family members (including primary) go to a single consolidated invoice. Primary is NOT billed separately.
- **Invite flow**: Admin creates member with `status: 'invited'` → generates 7-day token → member visits `/invite/[token]` → sets password → Supabase Auth user created → member activated.

## Database Schema (44 tables, all RLS-enabled)

**Core**: `clubs`, `membership_tiers`, `families`, `members`, `facilities`, `booking_slots`, `bookings`, `booking_waitlist`, `events`, `event_rsvps`, `invoices`, `payments`, `announcements`, `chat_conversations`, `chat_messages`

**Dining/POS**: `menu_categories`, `menu_items`, `dining_orders`, `dining_order_items`, `pos_configs`, `pos_transactions`, `pos_transaction_items`

**Advanced Billing**: `spending_minimums`, `spending_tracking`, `assessments`, `assessment_members`, `billing_cycles`, `billing_credits`

**Guest Management**: `guest_policies`, `guests`, `guest_visits`, `guest_fee_schedules`

**Notifications**: `notification_preferences`, `notification_log`, `notification_templates`

**Digital Cards**: `digital_passes`, `nfc_tap_log`, `card_templates`

**Accounting**: `gl_accounts`, `gl_mappings`, `export_batches`, `journal_entries`

**Data Migration**: `import_batches`

**Golf**: `golf_rates`

Helper functions: `get_member_club_id()`, `is_club_admin()`. Auto-updated `updated_at` triggers on mutable tables.

**Supabase project**: `iicwnlruopqhrzkgjsmu` (us-east-1)

## Feature Modules (Status)

### Core MVP (fully wired)
1. **Member Management** — Full CRUD: list/search/filter, detail page, add/edit modals, invite system (token-based, 7-day expiry), resend invite, deactivate/reactivate, role-based access, email notifications
2. **Bookings** — Multi-step tee time wizard, slot selection with availability, my bookings (edit/cancel), waitlist with auto-promotion on cancellation, admin schedule config (generate slots), admin golf rates CRUD, email confirmations
3. **Events** — Event list (role-based), detail with capacity bar, RSVP flow (attending/declined/maybe) with capacity enforcement, admin CRUD with draft→publish workflow, attendee management
4. **Communications** — Announcement list (admin: all/published/drafts tabs; member: published only), create/edit/delete, priority levels (low/normal/high/urgent), tier-targeted audience, email blast on publish
5. **AI Chat** — Claude API endpoint, chat UI with suggested prompts, iOS support via shared endpoint
6. **Billing & Payments** — Billing engine with dues calculation, family consolidated billing, spending minimum tracking + shortfall invoicing, assessments (capital/seasonal with installments), billing cycle tracking. **Not yet wired to Stripe** — engine is tested but payments are manual/seeded.

### Competitive Analysis Features (built)
7. **Golf Tee Times & Rates** — Dynamic pricing by facility/holes/day/time, member vs guest rates, admin CRUD
8. **Dining & Menu Orders** — Full menu system (categories + items), POS transaction tracking across 4 locations
9. **Guest Management** — Guest registration, configurable policies (per facility, blackout days, visit limits), fee schedules with weekend surcharges, visit tracking with auto-invoicing
10. **Data Migration** — Import tools for Jonas/Northstar/ClubEssential/CSV with field mapping, validation, and progress tracking
11. **Advanced Billing** — Spending minimums per tier, shortfall enforcement, capital assessments with installment plans, family billing consolidation, member credits/adjustments
12. **Accounting & GL Export** — Chart of accounts, GL mappings, journal entries, export batches (QuickBooks/Sage/Xero/CSV)
13. **Push Notifications** — Server infrastructure with per-member category preferences, notification templates with {{variable}} placeholders, delivery tracking
14. **AI Insights Dashboard** — AI-powered analytics dashboard
15. **Digital Member Cards (NFC)** — Apple/Google Wallet pass generation, NFC tap-to-check-in with 30s dedup, barcode-to-member resolution, card design templates, mobile wallet buttons (platform-aware)

### Testing
- **82 unit tests** covering billing engine (dues cycles, family consolidation, shortfall), spending tracker, guest policy enforcement, and pass generator (barcode determinism, Apple/Google pass structure)
- Test files in `__tests__/` directories alongside source files

## Conventions
- Package names use `@club/` scope (e.g., `@club/web`, `@club/shared`)
- **Web**: CSS uses custom properties (`--primary`, `--background`, etc.) defined in `globals.css` with dark mode support via `prefers-color-scheme`
- Supabase server client (web): `import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server"` (async, uses cookies)
- Supabase browser client (web): `import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/client"`
- Web dashboard pages are server components by default; add `"use client"` only when needed
- **iOS**: Native SwiftUI views, Supabase Swift SDK for auth and data. When building new web features, always port them to the iOS app in the same session.
- Green theme: primary color is `#16a34a` (light) / `#22c55e` (dark) — consistent across web and iOS

## Demo Accounts (Supabase Auth)
| Role | Email | Name | Tier |
|------|-------|------|------|
| Admin | `admin@greenfieldcc.com` | Max Hunter | — |
| Staff | `staff@greenfieldcc.com` | Sarah Chen | Standard |
| Member | `member@greenfieldcc.com` | James Wilson | Standard |
| Member | `golf@greenfieldcc.com` | Emily Brooks | Golf |

16 additional seeded members (no auth users — use invite flow or create manually).

## Seed Data (live DB)
- 1 club (Greenfield CC), 4 tiers, 7 facilities, 20 members, 3 families
- 1,008 booking slots (golf tee times + dining), 22 bookings
- 4 events, 16 RSVPs
- 20 invoices (paid/sent/overdue), 8 payments
- 5 guests (1 blocked), 7 guest visits, 3 guest policies, 4 fee schedules
- 4 POS configs, 10 POS transactions (dining, bar, pro shop, snack bar + 1 refund)
- 4 spending minimums, 2 assessments, 3 billing cycles
- 5 announcements, 5 notification templates, 1 card template
- 10 GL accounts, 4 GL mappings
- 8 menu categories, 57 menu items (Main Dining + Grill Room)

## Workflow: "Commit and Push"
When the user says **"commit and push"** (or similar), always perform ALL of the following steps in order:
1. **Run tests** — `pnpm test` must pass before committing
2. **Commit** — stage relevant files and commit with a descriptive message
3. **Push** — `git push origin main` (or current branch)
4. **Deploy to Vercel** — run `vercel --prod` from the repo root to trigger a production deployment (don't wait for build to finish, just confirm it was triggered)
5. **Migrations reminder** — if any new or modified files exist in `packages/supabase/migrations/`, list them and remind the user to run the SQL manually in the Supabase dashboard SQL Editor (`https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/iicwnlruopqhrzkgjsmu/sql/new`).

**Important**: Always confirm each step's result before moving to the next. If any step fails, stop and report the error rather than continuing.
